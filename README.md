# Advent of Code

Solutions to the Advent of Code 2015 challenge:

http://adventofcode.com/

## Dependencies

None! Just need NodeJS or a web browser (preferably Chrome). No need to install any additional packages.

Some of the solutions have been written to be run on the browser (notably those lacking a `challenge-in.txt` file).
To run those simply open the input page for your challenge and copy paste the solution code into the developer console
of the page.

## Installing and running

- Download or clone the repository.
- Extract the contents.
- Open a command prompt/terminal window.
- Change into the directory you have extracted the contents to.
- Change into the directory for the day you want to execute the code on.
- Run with `node challenge-1.js` for running part 1 of the challenge or `node challenge-2.js` for running part 2.

*Note* - By default, the input for all the challenges is read from the `challenge-in.txt` file. Replace the input in the file with your own for running on custom input.
